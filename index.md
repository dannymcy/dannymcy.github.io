## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk), co-supervised by Prof. [Andrew Markham](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/andrew.markham/) and Prof. [Niki Trigoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niki_Trigoni). My study is generously funded by the EPSRC DTP International Doctoral Scholar scholarship. Prior to this, I worked as a research assistant in [Cambridge Machine Learning Systems Lab](https://mlsys.cst.cam.ac.uk/), supervised by Prof. [Nicholas Lane](https://niclane.org/). I obtained my B.S.E. degree from [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), completing multiple projects under the guidances of Prof. [Andrew Owens](https://andrewowens.com/), Prof. [Wenzhen Yuan](http://robotouch.ri.cmu.edu/yuanwz/), and Prof. [Paul Green](https://www.umtri.umich.edu/people/green-paul-a/). I also spent lovely times (2023) interning at [Flower Labs](https://flower.ai/).

## Research Interests

My main research interest focuses on developing intelligent agents that live in both virtual and physical worlds. So far, my Ph.D. work falls in the intersection of 3D Understanding and Robot Learning.

<!-- My Ph.D. work mainly builds on two closely-related questions: -->

<!-- 1. Can we generate datasets of 3D shape with high fidelity and establish pose correspondences from large-scale in-the-wild 2D images?
2. Can we use features from 3D space to enhance the capabilities of image generative models? -->

On the side, I also enjoy working with vision applications that utilize various modalities (Vision, Tactile) and AI methods that are less centralized and more collaborative (Federated Learning).
