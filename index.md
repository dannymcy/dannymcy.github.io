## About Me

I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk), co-supervised by Prof. [Andrew Markham](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/andrew.markham/) and Prof. [Niki Trigoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niki_Trigoni). My study is generously funded by the EPSRC DTP International Doctoral Scholarship. I had the privilege of collaborating closely with [Xavier Puig](https://www.xavierpuigf.com/) and [Ruta Desai](https://rutadesai.github.io/) at [FAIR, Meta](https://ai.meta.com/research/#fundamental-and-applied) (2024) and spent wonderful times interning at [Roku](https://www.roku.com/en-gb/) (2024) and [Flower Labs](https://flower.ai/) (2023).

Prior to my Ph.D., I worked as a research assistant in [Cambridge Machine Learning Systems Lab](https://mlsys.cst.cam.ac.uk/), supervised by Prof. [Nicholas Lane](https://niclane.org/). I obtained my B.S.E. degree from [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), completing multiple projects under the guidances of Prof. [Andrew Owens](https://andrewowens.com/), Prof. [Wenzhen Yuan](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/yuanwz), and Prof. [Paul Green](https://www.umtri.umich.edu/people/green-paul-a/).

<p style="color:red;">I am actively looking for a research internship for Summer 2025. Feel free to contact me for any research opportunities!</p>

## Research Interests

My main research interest focuses on developing human-centered embodied and AI agents in open-world settings. My Ph.D. work mainly builds on three closely-related questions:
<!-- So far, my Ph.D. work falls in the intersection of 3D Understanding, Robot Learning, and Computer Vision. -->

1. Most agents today use VLMs/VLAs as their core reasoning component. How can we enhance their reasoning and planning capabilities in dynamic 3D environments, and bridge the gap from visual perception and task descriptions to low-level actions?
2. How can we represent humans within robot simulation platforms, considering factors such as motion feasibility, human-object interactions, and extending to human preferences, traits, and habits?
3. How can we design systems and frameworks that allow us to study open-ended human-robot collaboration, accommodating human preferences, needs, and spontaneous intentions?

On the side, I also enjoy working with vision applications that utilize various modalities (Vision, Tactile) and AI methods that are less centralized and more collaborative (Federated Learning).
